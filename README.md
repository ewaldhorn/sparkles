# Sparkles
Show bright spots in the video feed using Go and TinyGo.

## What is this
Sparkles is a simple tool I originally built in JavaScript to make it easy to
see where the brighest spots of a video feed is. This is used to better position
cameras so that the feed is clearer.

## TinyGo
Most of my work is done using the official [Go](https://go.dev/) compiler, but
for WebAssembly I've been experimenting with [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/) because
it gives me much more compact binaries to deploy. Check it out, it's an interesting
project!

## Zed
I'm exploring using [Zed](https://zed.dev/) as my primary editor and there's a `zed.sh`
file that starts Zed with the correct WASM environment variables so that the editor
has context about the code.  You are of course not forced to use Zed, the project
does not depend on it in any way.

## Task
To save myself endless typing, [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) is used to do things
like manage the build process etc.  There's a `Taskfile.yml` file that contains
all the build, run, clean and lint instructions for the project.
